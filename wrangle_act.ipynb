    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The goal of this project is to wrangle data from [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs) Twitter's account using Python and document the whole process in a Jupyter Notebook  named wrangle_act.ipynb i.e. this notebook. My aim is to wrangle this data for interesting and trustworthy analyses using visualizations.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Project Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully assessing and cleaning the entire dataset would require exceptional effort so only a subset of its issues (eight quality issues and two tidiness issues at minimum) needed to be assessed and cleaned.The tasks for this project were:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data wrangling, which consists of:\n",
    "  * Gathering data\n",
    "  * Assessing data\n",
    "  * Cleaning data\n",
    "* Storing, analyzing, and visualizing our wrangled data\n",
    "* Reporting on 1) our data wrangling efforts and 2) our data analyses and visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gathering Data for this Project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enhanced Twitter Archive\n",
    "\n",
    "The WeRateDogs Twitter archive provided by Udacity. This contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything.I manually downloaded this file manually by clicking the following link: [twitter_archive_enhanced.csv](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/59a4e958_twitter-archive-enhanced/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Predictions File\n",
    "The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file (image_predictions.tsv) is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and the following URL: [image_predictions.tsv](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Data via the Twitter API\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tweet's retweet count and favorite (\"like\") count at minimum, and any additional data you find interesting. Using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt file. Each tweet's JSON data should be written to its own line. Then read this .txt file line by line into a pandas DataFrame with (at minimum) tweet ID, retweet count, and favorite count.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points to keep in mind when data wrangling for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We only want original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.\n",
    "* Fully assessing and cleaning the entire dataset requires exceptional effort so only a subset of its issues (eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues at minimum) need to be assessed and cleaned.\n",
    "* Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of tidy data.\n",
    "* The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.\n",
    "* We do not need to gather the tweets beyond August 1st, 2017. We can, but note that we won't be able to gather the image predictions for these tweets since we don't have access to the algorithm used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acceptance Criterion \n",
    "\n",
    "* Assessing Data for this Project\n",
    "  * Detect and document at least eight (8) quality issues \n",
    "  * Two (2) tidiness issues in your wrangle_act.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Cleaning Data for this Project\n",
    "  * Clean each of the issues you documented while assessing. \n",
    "  * The result should be a high quality and tidy master pandas DataFrame (or DataFrames, if appropriate).\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Storing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Data for this Project\n",
    "  * Store the clean DataFrame(s) in a CSV file with the main one named twitter_archive_master.csv. \n",
    "  * If additional files exist because multiple tables are required for tidiness, name these files appropriately.\n",
    "  * Additionally, you may store the cleaned data in a SQLite database (which is to be submitted as well if you do).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analyze and visualize your wrangled data.\n",
    "  * At least three (3) insights and\n",
    "  * one (1) visualization must be produced\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reporting for this Project\n",
    "  * Create a 300-600 word written report called wrangle_report.pdf or wrangle_report.html that briefly describes your wrangling efforts. This is to be framed as an internal document.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Create a 250-word-minimum written report called act_report.pdf or act_report.html that communicates the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from your wrangled data. This is to be framed as an external document, like a blog post or magazine article, for example.\n"
